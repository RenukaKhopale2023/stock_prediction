# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for Google's stock price. We employ historical stock price data, along with various machine learning algorithms, to forecast future prices. Predictions can help investors make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

# Dataset
We use a historical dataset of Google stock prices for training and testing the prediction model. The dataset may contain columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adj Close. You can find the dataset in the data directory.

# Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
jupyter
yfinance (for downloading stock price data)
You can install these libraries using pip by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Data Collection: The project uses Yahoo Finance to download historical stock price data. Make sure you have a working internet connection.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for the model.

Model Training: We employ various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, ARIMA) to predict future stock prices.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is assessed using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: You can visualize the predictions and actual stock prices using the provided Jupyter notebooks.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Model
We have experimented with different models to predict stock prices. These models include:

Linear Regression
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R2)
